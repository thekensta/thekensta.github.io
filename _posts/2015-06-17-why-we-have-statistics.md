There are lots of methods to evaluate a straight forward AB test. 
Within the statistics world - applied, academic, where ever - there are endless
articles telling you are are doing it wrong (and some saying how to do it right).

Few agree outright, which leads to the question about why bother at all? 
Isn't there a *right* way for calculating statistics? 
This is something I find really hard to answer. 

The best answer I have come up with is that statistics help us make the right
decisions more often.

Whether you are trying to avoid false positives, false negatives or minimise regret; 
whether need quick answers or can run classical models or vast samples, the 
statistics will vary.

It isn't hard to explain that errors and samples matter, I think the rest is 
really about being as least likely to be wrong for your trade-offs as possible.
