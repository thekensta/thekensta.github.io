There are lots of methods to evaluate a straight forward AB test. 
Within the statistics world - applied, academic, where ever - there are endless
articles telling you are are doing it wrong (and some saying how to do it right).

Few agree outright, which leads to the question about why bother at all? 
Isn't there a *right* way for calculating statistics? 
This is something I find really hard to answer. 

I don't think it is hard to explain that errors and samples matter, that samples and values vary using simple
coin tossing examples but I fall short when it comes to the existence of myriad 
solutions to the same problem.

The best answer I have come up with is that we use statistics to help us make the right
decisions *more often*.

Whether you are trying to avoid false positives, false negatives or minimise regret; 
whether need quick answers or can run classical models or vast samples, the 
statistics will vary.  In a business environment, with different costs, volumes and risks
there are always trade-offs with the rate at which we learn, or can expect errors.

Ultimately it is really about being as least-likely to be wrong as possible.
