Chris, a data scientist working at [Holiday Extras][hx].

Initially studied Neuroscience, started looking at computer models of protein structure and found himself doing a PhD in Medical Image processing.

Now works mostly with web data but open to options.

Experimenting with Github as the whole world seems to be here now.

Loves windsurfing and mountain biking.  Not in need of any other expensive hobbies.
